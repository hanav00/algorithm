# Intuition
The code aims to provide an algorithm to convert a Roman numeral string into an integer. The basic idea is to iterate through the given string, convert each Roman numeral character to an integer, and sum them up. Special cases, such as "IV" (4) and "IX" (9), are handled by checking for smaller numerals before larger ones.

# Approach
1. We create an integer array, `intArray`, to store the integer values corresponding to the Roman numerals in the given string.
2. We iterate through the Roman numeral string, `s`, and convert each character to its integer value using the `ConvertToInt` function. The results are stored in the `intArray`.
3. We initialize an integer, `answer`, to store the final result.
4. We iterate through the `intArray`, and for each numeral, we check if the next numeral is larger than the current one.
    - If it is larger, we subtract the current numeral's value from the answer (e.g., "IV" becomes 4), as it is a special case.
    - If it is not larger, we add the current numeral's value to the answer.
5. Finally, the `answer` contains the integer value of the Roman numeral string, which is returned as the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the input Roman numeral string once.
- Space complexity: O(n) - We use an integer array to store the converted values, which has the same length as the input string.


# Code
```
public class Solution {
    public int RomanToInt(string s) {
        int[] intArray = new int[s.Length];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++) {
            intArray[i] = ConvertToInt(s[i]);
        }

        int answer = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < intArray.Length; i++) {
            if (i < intArray.Length - 1 && intArray[i] < intArray[i + 1]) {
                answer -= intArray[i];
            } else {
                answer += intArray[i];
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }

    public int ConvertToInt(char a) {
        int num = a switch {
            'I' => 1,
            'V' => 5,
            'X' => 10,
            'L' => 50,
            'C' => 100,
            'D' => 500,
            'M' => 1000,
            _ => 0
        };
        return num;
    }
}

```
